# 🤖 AI vs Student Text Classifier

This project fine-tunes a BERT-based Large Language Model to classify whether a given paragraph was written by a human student or generated by AI. It includes model training, evaluation, error analysis, and a fully functional Streamlit demo.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Model**: `bert-base-uncased` fine-tuned for binary classification (`AI` vs. `Student`)
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle LLM Text Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajwaldongre/llm-detect-ai-generated-vs-student-generated-text)
- **Goal**: Develop a classifier that detects whether text is machine-generated or human-written in academic settings.

## 🧪 Model Performance

| Metric     | Score    |
|------------|----------|
| Accuracy   | 100%     |
| Precision  | 100%     |
| Recall     | 100%     |
| F1 Score   | 100%     |

🔍 **Note**: High scores due to clean, labeled dataset and clear AI vs. student writing patterns.
