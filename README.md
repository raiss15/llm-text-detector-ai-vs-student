# 🧠 AI vs Student Text Classification using BERT

A fine-tuned BERT model that classifies whether a paragraph was generated by an AI language model or written by a student. This project also includes a polished Streamlit web app for real-time text classification.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Detect and classify text as AI-generated or student-written
- **Model**: `bert-base-uncased`, fine-tuned using Hugging Face Transformers
- **Dataset**: Kaggle – [LLM Detect AI vs Student Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajwaldongre/llm-detect-ai-generated-vs-student-generated-text)
- **Frontend**: Streamlit-based UI for live classification
- **Result**: Achieved 100% accuracy on test set with full precision, recall, and F1-score
